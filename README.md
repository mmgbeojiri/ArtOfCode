# Art Of Code Project - The Poopynugget Trilogy

## Overview
The Poopynugget Trilogy is a group of four projects named after the four main Sonic Games on the Sega Genesis, Sonic 1, Sonic CD, Sonic 2, and Sonic 3 & Knuckles for the Art of Code Project. Poopynugget CD is the final submission for the project. They are all based on spiraling shapes with a centerpiece in the middle.
